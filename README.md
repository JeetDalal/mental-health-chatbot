# Bhava AI: RAG-Based Mental Health Chatbot

## Overview

Bhava AI is an AI-powered chatbot designed to provide mental health support using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **emotion recognition**. It offers personalized, context-aware responses to users seeking mental wellness guidance. The chatbot integrates emotion analytics, activity recommendations, and crisis management to ensure reliable and empathetic support.

## Features

## Problem Statement

Mental health issues are widespread, but access to reliable and personalized support is often limited. Existing chatbots rely on predefined responses, lacking **context-awareness** and **emotion detection**. Bhava AI bridges this gap by dynamically retrieving relevant knowledge and adapting responses to usersâ€™ emotions.
